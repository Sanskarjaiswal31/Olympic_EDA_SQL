## Overview

This project delves into **120 years of Olympic Games data**, offering insights into participation trends, athlete achievements, and country-wise medal counts. Using **SQL**, I solved 20 analytical problems that explore the historical significance and competitive edge of the Olympics across different eras.

4. **Which year saw the highest and lowest number of participants?**
5. **Which country won the most medals overall?**
6. **Which sports have been consistently played in every Summer Olympics?**
7. **In which sports has India won the highest number of medals?**
   
...and many more intriguing questions about athlete performance and nation-wise accomplishments.
